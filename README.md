# StrathWalk 
The StrathWalk app aims to get students at Strathclyde healthier and more relaxed by showing them walks they can do 
between classes.

This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

This app uses Google Maps Platform API Routes services. Use of Google Maps Platform services through this app is subject to the Google Maps Platform's [Terms of Use](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms/) and [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

Routes and polylines generated by this app were Powered by Google, Â©2024 Google. 

# Installing the App

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

### Step 1: Clone the repository

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

To install the app's dependencies, run...

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
